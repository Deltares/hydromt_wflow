Unreleased
==========

Added
-----
- New function **setup_1dmodel_connection** to connect wflow to 1D river model (eg Delft3D FM 1D, HEC-RAS, etc.) `PR #210 <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow/pull/210>`_
- New setup method for the **KsatHorFrac** parameter **setup_ksathorfarc** to up-downscale existing ksathorfrac maps. `PR #255 <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow/pull/255>`_
- Workflow to compute brooks corey c for the wflow layers based on soilgrids data, soilgrids_brooks_corey. PR #242

Changed
-------
- **setup_soilmaps**: the user can now supply variable sbm soil layer thicknesses. The Brooks Corey coefficient is then computed as weighted average over the sbm layers. PR #242
- **setup_outlets**: the IDs of wflow_subcatch are used to define the outlets IDs rather than [1:n]. PR #247

Fixed
-----
- Wrong dtype for wflow_subcatch map. PR #247,
- Removed building a wflow model without a config file in the build notebook.

v0.5.0 (February 2024)
======================
Better handling of nodata and a switch from ini to yaml for configuration.

Added
-----
- **setup_rivers**: Add river depth based on rivdph columns in river_geom_fn rather than only computed from qbankfull column.

Changed

- **setup_gauges**: gauges_fn can be both GeoDataFrame or GeoDataset (new) data_type.
- New **setup_floodplains** method, that allows the user the choose either 1D or 2D floodplains. Note: requires pyflwdir v0.5.7. `PR #123 <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow/pull/123>`_
- In **setup_lakes**: Add option to prepare rating curve tables for lake Q-V and Q-H curves. Also updated LakeOutFlowFunc and LakeStorFunc accordingly. `PR #158 <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow/pull/158>`_

- in **setup_areamap**: name of the added map is based on column name of the vector data (col2raster) instead of name of the vector data file (area_fn). Allows to add several maps from one vector data file.

Fixed
-----

  Set the min_rivlen_ratio argument to a value larger than zero to apply the smoothing.
  Note: requires pyflwdir v0.5.6 `PR #92 <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow/pull/92>`_

Deprecated
----------

v0.2.0 (5 August 2022)
======================
We now use rioxarray to read raster data. We recommend reinstalling your hydromt and hydromt_wflow environment including the rioxarray package.
This enables the writting of CF compliant netcdf files for wflow staticmaps.nc and inmaps.nc.
Following an update in xarray, hydromt version should be >= 0.5.0.

Fixed
-----
- correct float32 dtype for all landuse based maps (by changing values in all lookup tables to floats)
- write **CF-compliant** staticmaps.nc and inmaps.nc
- CRS issue when deriving subcatch for user defined gauges in setup_gauges
- update times in config depending on forcing date range availability in **write_forcing** methods #97

Changed
-------
- In the naming of the generated hydrodem map, it is now specified if a D4 or D8 conditionning has been applied for land cells.
- uint8 dtype *wflow_rivers* and *wflow_streamorder* maps
- except for coordinates (incl *x_out* and *y_out*) all variables are saved with at most 32 bit depth
- new dtype and nodata arguments in **setup_constant_pars**
- read boolean PCRaster maps with int type to be consistent with netcdf based maps
- use latest hydromt github version for the test environment files.
- in **setup_glaciers** predicate to intersects glacier data with model region is 'intersects' (the old 'contains' was not used anyway due to a bug in core).
- in **setup_reservoirs** and **setup_lakes** the predicate 'contains' to open data is now officially used after a bugfix in hydromt core (cf #150).

Added
-----
- nodata argument to **setup_areamap** with a default of -1 (was 0 and not user defined).

v0.1.4 (18 February 2022)
=========================

Changed
-------
- **setup_riverwidth** method **deprecated** (will be removed in future versions) in favour of setup_rivers. We suggest to remove the setup_riverwidth component from your ini files.
- **setup_rivers** calculate river width and depth based on the attributes of the new **river_geom_fn** river geometry file. We suggest adding "river_geom_fn = rivers_lin2019_v1" to the setup_rivers component of your ini files.
- In **setup_soilmaps** the interpolation of missing values (interpolate_na function) is executed on the model parameters at the model resolution, rather than on the original raw soilgrids data at higher resolution. This change will generate small differences in the parameter values, but (largely) improve memory usage.
- Possibility to use any dataset and not just the default ones for setup_laimaps, setup_lakes, setup_glaciers. See the documentation for data requirements.

Added
-----
- Possibility to write_forcing in several files based on time frequency (fn_freq argument).
- setup_hydrodem method for hydrological conditioned elevation used with "local-inertial" routing
- workflow.river.river_bathymetry method to derive river width and depth estimates.
  Note that the new river width estimates are different and result in different model results.
- moved basemaps workflows (hydrography and topography) from HydroMT core. Note that HydroMT_Wflow v0.1.3 there should be used together with HydroMT v0.4.4 (not newer!)
- new ID columns for the outlets staticgeoms
- new ``index_col`` attribute to setup_gauges to choose a specific column of gauges_fn as ID for Wflow_gauges

Fixed
-----
- Calculation of lake_b parameter in setup_lakes.
- Add a minimum averaged discharge to lakes to avoid division by zero when computing lake_b.
- When writting several forcing files instead of one, their time_units should be the same to get one Wflow run (time_units option in write_forcing)
- Filter gauges that could not be snapped to river (if snap_to_river is True) in setup_gauges
- Avoid duplicates in the toml csv column for gauges
- Fill missing values in landslope with zeros within the basin mask
- prevent writing a _FillValue on the time coordinate of forcing data


v0.1.3 (4 October 2021)
=======================

v0.1.1 (21 May 2021)
====================
This release adds more functionnality for saving forcing data for Wflow and fixes several bugs for some parameter values and soilgrids workflow.

Added
-----
