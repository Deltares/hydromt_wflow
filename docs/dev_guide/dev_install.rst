Developer's environment
=======================
If you want to download the HydroMT-Wflow plugin directly from git to easily have access to the latest developments or
make changes to the code you can use the following steps.

First, clone the HydroMT-Wflow plugin ``git`` repo from
`github <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow>`_, then navigate into the
the code folder (where the envs folder and pyproject.toml are located):

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow.git
    $ cd hydromt_wflow

Then, make and activate a new hydromt-wflow conda environment based on the envs/hydromt-wflow.yml
file contained in the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda env create -f envs/hydromt-wflow.yml
    $ conda activate hydromt-wflow

If you wish to make changes in HydroMT-Wflow, you should make an editable install of the plugin.
This is possible using the `flit install <https://flit.pypa.io/en/latest/cmdline.html#flit-install>`_ command.

For Windows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ flit install --pth-file

For Linux:

.. code-block:: console

    $ flit install -s
