Working with the Wflow SBM model
==================================

With the Hydromt-Wflow plugin, you can easily work with Wflow SBM models.
This plugin contains relevant functions for setting up or adjusting models:

* :ref:`building a model <wflow_build>`: building a model from scratch.
* :ref:`updating a model <wflow_update>`: updating an existing model (e.g. update datafeeds).
* :ref:`clipping a model <wflow_clip>`: changing the spatial domain of an existing model (e.g. select subbasins from a larger model).
