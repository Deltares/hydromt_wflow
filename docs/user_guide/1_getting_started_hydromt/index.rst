Getting started with HydroMT
================================

The core functionalities of HydroMT, such as the command-line interface (CLI), data catalog management, and region definitions, are documented in the main HydroMT documentation.
These topics are shared across all HydroMT model plugins (including HydroMT-Wflow) and are maintained in one central location to ensure consistency.
Refer to the sections below for the official and up-to-date information.
