Setup Method: setup_x
=====================

.. note::

   This section is currently under development and will be expanded in a future release.

The `setup_x` method is part of the Wflow model setup workflow. It is used to initialize specific components or configurations required for a model run. A full technical description of the method, including scientific background, parameterization, and example usage, will be added soon.

Planned content:
- Detailed description of the setup process and its role in the HydroMT-Wflow workflow.
- Equations and conceptual diagrams explaining the underlying hydrological processes.
- References to relevant literature.
- Example use cases and parameter configurations.
- Link to the API documentation for function arguments.

   Model classes :ref:`WflowSbmModel <api_wflowsbmmodel>` and :ref:`WflowSedimentModel <api_wflowsedimentmodel>`.
