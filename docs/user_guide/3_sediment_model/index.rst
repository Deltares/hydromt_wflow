Working with the Wflow Sediment model
=====================================



With the Hydromt-Wflow plugin, you can easily work with Wflow Sediment models.
This plugin contains as well relevant functions for setting up or adjusting Wflow Sediment models:

* :ref:`building a model <sediment_build>`: building a model from scratch.
* :ref:`updating a model <sediment_update>`: updating an existing model (e.g. update datafeeds).
* :ref:`clipping a model <sediment_clip>`: changing the spatial domain of an existing model (e.g. select subbasins from a larger model).
