    source_info:  KsatHorFrac estimated with Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) methods. These ML-based transfer functions are trained on soilgrids and validated with CAMELS-UK dataset in the UK. With these global maps, we expect good results in regions with geology and soil types similar to the UK. For other regions, this has still to be tested.
