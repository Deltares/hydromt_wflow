    "With HydroMT-Wflow, a user can choose to build a model in a geographic or projected coordinate system from an input Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Flow Direction (flwdir) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While DEM data are often available, this is not the always the case for the flow directions (flwdir). We made the choice to build a Wflow model directly from user provided DEM and flwdir datasets rather than reprojecting a DEM and/or deriving flwdir on the fly. This is because deriving flow directions is often an iterative process to be sure the flow directions matche the terrain and river network. Note that for the best results the flwdir data should be derived from a high-res DEM (<100 m spatial resolution). The HydroMT-Wflow model builder will automatically resample the flwdir data to the model resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we prefer to provide this notebook as a possible **pre-processing step** before calling a build a Wflow model with HydroMt-Wflow. Here we use the different [flow directions methods from HydroMT](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/api.html#flow-direction-methods) and [PyFlwDir](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/index.html)"
